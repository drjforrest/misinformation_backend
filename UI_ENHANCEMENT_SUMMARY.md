## Recommendation

**Use the Enhanced Interface** (`annotate-enhanced`) for all research activities related to your grant deliverables. The original interface should be considered deprecated for serious research use, as it lacks the sophisticated categorization and analysis capabilities required for your academic objectives.

The enhanced interface provides the comprehensive data collection needed to support:
- Canadian user identification research
- Multilingual community analysis
- Severity-based intervention planning
- Cultural competency assessment
- Publication-ready annotation datasets
