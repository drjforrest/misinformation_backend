# Health Misinformation Detection & Network Analysis Platform
## Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the development of an intelligent platform for detecting, analyzing, and responding to health misinformation within immigrant communities on Reddit. The system combines social network analysis with human-validated machine learning to create an early warning system for public health agencies and enable targeted intervention strategies.

### Project Overview

**Primary Objective:** Develop a proof-of-concept platform that identifies and maps the spread of sexual health misinformation among equity-deserving immigrant communities, with particular focus on gay men's health topics.

**Core Innovation:** Integration of network analysis with multilingual content detection to understand not just what misinformation exists, but how it spreads through vulnerable communities and where interventions would be most effective.

### Target User Groups

**Primary Users:**
- Public health researchers and implementation scientists
- Ministry of Health policy makers
- Community health organisations
- Academic institutions conducting health equity research

**Secondary Users:**
- Graduate researchers and trainees
- International health organisations
- Digital health platform developers

### Problem Statement

Immigrant communities face unique barriers to accessing accurate sexual health information, including language barriers, unfamiliarity with healthcare systems, and reliance on informal information networks. Current misinformation detection systems fail to:

1. Capture the multilingual nature of these conversations
2. Understand community-specific context and cultural nuances
3. Identify key network influencers and information pathways
4. Provide actionable insights for targeted public health responses
