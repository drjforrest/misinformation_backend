# üìä Multilingual Data Collection and ML Model Performance Report

## üìà Overview

We successfully collected multilingual health-related data from 39 targeted subreddits, with the following key metrics:

- **Total posts collected**: 35
- **Health-related posts**: 30 (85.7%)
- **Languages detected**: 4 (en, es, it, fr)
- **Successful translations**: 8 (100% success rate)

## ü§ñ ML Model Performance

### Translation Service
Our translation service successfully processed 8 translations with a 100% success rate:
- 3 translations for Italian content
- 2 translations for Spanish content (Mexico)
- 1 translation each for Spanish (Spain), French (Montreal), and Tagalog

### Language Detection
Language detection is working correctly, successfully identifying 4 different languages in our dataset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Issues

### 1. Low Language Diversity
We only detected content in 4 languages, below our target of 6+ languages. This suggests we need to expand our subreddit targeting to include more language-specific communities.

### 2. Translation Quality Issues
We identified 29 cases where translations were identical to the English source text, indicating potential issues with:
- **Tagalog**: 12 identical translations
- **Chinese (Simplified)**: 4 identical translations
- **Chinese (Traditional)**: 4 identical translations
- **Spanish**: 3 identical translations
- **French**: 6 identical translations

### 3. Subreddit Targeting
22 out of 39 subreddits (56%) failed to yield relevant health content, suggesting we need to refine our subreddit list.

## üí° Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Refine keyword translations** for technical health terms
2. **Expand subreddit targeting** to include more language-specific communities
3. **Implement translation quality validation** to catch identical translations

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Integrate specialized medical translation services** for health terminology
2. **Develop language-specific keyword lists** rather than relying solely on translation
3. **Add more Asian language support** (currently only Chinese variants are well-represented)

## üìå Next Steps

1. Address translation quality issues, particularly for Tagalog and French
2. Expand data collection to target additional language communities
3. Implement automated validation for translation quality
4. Continue monitoring model performance as we collect more data

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Our ML models are functioning correctly and providing value in multilingual data collection. The translation service is successfully processing content in multiple languages, though there are quality issues that need to be addressed. The language detection is working well, and our overall health content filtering is effective (85.7% health-related posts).
