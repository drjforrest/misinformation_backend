## Architecture

### Components
```
AnalyticsDashboardInterface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HealthMisinformationAnalytics (data processing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plotly Charts (visualizations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gradio Interface (web UI)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Export Functions (reporting)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Data Loading**: Connects to database and loads posts/comments
2. **Analysis**: Processes data through various analytical functions
3. **Visualization**: Creates interactive charts using Plotly
4. **Display**: Renders in Gradio web interface
5. **Export**: Generates JSON reports for external use

## Customization

### Adding New Visualizations
1. Create method in `AnalyticsDashboardInterface`
2. Return Plotly figure object
3. Add to dashboard tabs in `create_dashboard()`
4. Include in refresh function

### Modifying Insights
Edit the `generate_insights()` method in `HealthMisinformationAnalytics` to add custom insight categories or modify existing ones.

### Styling
Modify the CSS in the `gr.Blocks()` constructor to customize appearance:
```python
css="""
.gradio-container {max-width: 1200px !important}
.plot-container {height: 500px !important}
"""
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dashboard Won't Load
```bash
# Check if database is accessible
python -c "from src.analytics_dashboard import HealthMisinformationAnalytics; h = HealthMisinformationAnalytics(); print(h.load_data())"
```

#### Empty Visualizations
- Ensure data exists in database
- Check database connection settings in `config/settings.py`
- Verify data collection has completed

#### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Dashboard uses port 7862 by default
# Change in config/settings.py or modify launch script
```

### Memory Issues
For large datasets:
- Consider implementing data pagination
- Add data filtering options
- Use sampling for visualization

## Contributing

### Adding New Analytics
1. Add method to `HealthMisinformationAnalytics`
2. Create corresponding visualization method
3. Update dashboard interface
4. Add documentation

### Improving Visualizations
- Use consistent color schemes
- Ensure accessibility (color-blind friendly)
- Add informative hover text
- Include clear axis labels

## Integration

### With Annotation Interface
The analytics dashboard complements the annotation interface by providing:
- Context for posts being annotated
- Population-level patterns to inform annotation priorities
- Progress tracking for annotation efforts

### With External Tools
Export functionality allows integration with:
- R/Python analysis scripts
- Academic paper generation
- Presentation tools
- Other research platforms

## Performance Considerations

### Large Datasets
- Dashboard loads data on startup (may take time for large datasets)
- Consider implementing lazy loading for very large collections
- Use database indexing for faster queries

### Refresh Frequency
- Manual refresh prevents unnecessary database hits
- Consider caching frequently accessed data
- Implement incremental updates for real-time dashboards

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time data streaming
- Advanced filtering options
- Custom date range selection
- Comparative analysis tools
- Machine learning model integration
- Collaborative annotation metrics

### API Integration
- REST API for external access
- Webhook support for automated updates
- Integration with academic databases
- Social media platform APIs
